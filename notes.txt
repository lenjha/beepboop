Able to enter new number and see new results, over and over again







count up to inputted number
replace numbers containing "1" with "boop!"
replace numbers containing "0" with "beep!"
replace numbers divisible by 3 with "sorry"






newNum = (number - 1)
outputArray.pop(newNum)

i = newNum, i < 0, i --
  newNum = (newNum - 1)
  outputArray.pop(newNum)

loop newNum to subtract 1 from itself until it goes under 0, popping into outputArray every time
